## Problem Statement
Students often need a quick and reliable way to calculate their average marks and overall grades across multiple subjects. Manual calculation can be error-prone and time-consuming, especially for those with many subjects. There is a need for a user-friendly software tool to automate this process.

## Scope of the Project
This tool aims to provide a GUI-based calculator for students, allowing them to input marks for any number of subjects. The software validates all inputs, computes the average marks, and determines the overall grade, all within an intuitive graphical interface.

## Target Users
- School and college students who want to calculate grades efficiently.
- Teachers who may need to verify students' grades quickly.
- Anyone seeking a simple grade calculation utility for educational purposes.

## High-level Features
- Dynamic field creation based on user input for the number of subjects.
- Input validation for proper marks entry (0-100 range).
- Real-time average and grade calculation.
- Clear display of results in the GUI.
- Error handling for invalid or incomplete data entries.
