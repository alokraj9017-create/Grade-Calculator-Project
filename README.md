# Student Grade Calculator

## Overview of the Project
This is a desktop GUI application that lets users calculate their average marks and final grade based on marks entered for multiple subjects. The app provides real-time validation and displays the results and grade clearly. It is designed as an easy-to-use tool for both students and educators.

## Features
- Enter number of subjects and dynamically add mark entry fields.
- Input validation for total subjects (integer > 0) and marks (between 0 and 100).
- Calculates average and displays assigned grade (A/B/C/D/F).
- Error messages for invalid input.
- Simple, intuitive GUI, ready to use.

## Technologies/Tools Used
- Language: Python 3.x
- GUI Library: Tkinter (standard Python library, no installation needed)
